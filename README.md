# myOfflineAi - ChatConsole
> 
> Prototype - For testing, education and inspiration

<br>

A transparent, offline-first and privacy-first multimodal Ai console where you can talk, type, show images, adjust parameters and create specialized assistants. Uses Flask for the backend, Whisper for Speech-to-Text (STT), Kokoro for Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Ollama for the Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Ideal for privacy concious users and enthusiasts who want to experiment with Ollama Ai models. The single file architecture makes it easy to use Ai to customize the app or to fix bugs. Simply give the Ai the app.py file and tell it what changes you want. After the initail setup there's no need to use the command line - simply double click a file to run the app.
